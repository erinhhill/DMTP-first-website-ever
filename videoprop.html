	For the last major part of this ecology website's construction, I will be using the video components to observe the interactions visitors have with the space itself. It will be of particular interest to me to record daily uses of the space by different people at different times on different days. For example, there is an event known as Sunset Salsa that happens on the Christopher Street Pier at sunset a few days a week where several people set up a dance floor under the pavillion and dance the salsa with various partners as a way to meet people and hone their dancing skills. During sunny days many people will be walking along the river or sunning themselves on benches and lawns along the Hudson River Park walkway. I cannot predict what I will see, but by recording the interactions between the space and its visitors I have the opportunity to observe any ecological impact the visitors to the river have on the space, such as leaving trash behind. In the case of the Sunset Salsa dancers, they left behind a spilled bottle of baby powder, the residue of which eventually blew away with the wind into the river
    <br><br>My video will also look at the juxtaposition of natural emelents such as the river and wildlife with manmade elements such as public bathrooms, dilapidated architecture, exercise stations, and various piers and lookout points. The river is an interesting place due to the duality of the space; A large and natural landmark such as the river that has been built into one of the most populous cities in the world. I hope to capture the strain the space is under, from manmade infrastructural decay to the occasional water bottle floating by. The duality of the space is a large part of my audio proposal as well, as you go from bustling street to calm waterway, and I would like that to translate visually in my project without just seeming like a tourism bureau video. It is a special space that needs a lot of help, and through my video I will demonstrate that.

<p style="text-align:center">The first thing I looked over in the "Evil Media" collection was the piece on Algorithms. A particular quote caught my eye, "Extended in this way, the algorithm, as an idea, thus becomes an 'analyzer' of social relations, particularly for processes that do not appear to have any obvious, explicit implementation in computational systems as such" (83). I found this interesting because it got me thinking about the role algorithms played in the most recent election. As I touched on it in my presentation, social media and algorithms go hand in hand. Algorithms determine what a large part of the content you see on that site, and so during the election people were only exposed to political viewpoints that echoed only their own. Due to the narrow exposure many people had, and also the fact that a large majority of digital media users get their news solely from the social networking sites they use, the results of the election came as a huge shock to a large majority of the country. This is not to say that either outcome of the election was right or wrong, but a lot of people on both sides were essentially ignoring the concerns of many because their social media accounts were set up as an echo chamber. A more responsible use of social media algorithms would have been to encourage discourse among all parties involved in the election, and it may have brought about an exchange of ideas that affected the outcome of the election. Due to the pervasiveness of social media, the algorithms of digital life have manifested in physical life as well. As discussed on page 84, "The requirement that data be structured extends this interplay into the more general abstract architecture of social and cultural practices organized by, for, and as information" (84). Essentially with the amount of data we use as a society now, to structure it properly within the confines of our existence calls for an orderly method of architecture, such as the grid with which cities are planned. "The grid" being both the pattern in which buildings are arranged as well as the power system from which the inhabitants of those buildings receive their power, and thus their data. 
	Interestingly, the phrase "off the grid" takes on a new meaning when discussing it in the terms of algorithmicity. Living off the grid is seen as inconvenient and an uncommon choice for somebody to make, but by removing oneself from the grid, they are also forfeiting their right to participate in the cultural and societal data exchange of our time. 'Off the grid' now becomes a phrase for the uninformed and the disconnected, not the people far away (due to the nature of communication technology, distance is much less relevant as long as one has access to the grid). 
This decision of being on or off the grid leads us to the paradox of our time: "Either refashion yourself to meet the imperious demands of more and different types of data, or consign yourself to data oblivion" (87). Not only does living outside of the algorithm and not having contact with it become inconvenient, it also becomes lonely. those not meant for isolation can find it to be quite a struggle, but maintaining their relevant knowledge in an increasingly technological world, is also very difficult. One must choose whether they value their freedom, or contact with the rest of the world.
	We see algorithms employed often in the use of data mining of personal information on social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. "From some points of view, the growing volume of personal data available does indeed look likely to threaten a totalitarian encroachment on basic human rights" (97). Exploring this notion of privacy further, I quickly remembered Luis Borge's Panopticon. A hypothetical prison architecture in which the prisoners are held in small cells, formed in a circle. At the center of the circle is a watchtower so high, it is obstructed by clouds, and the prisoners cannot see when they are being guarded versus not. This method ensures that no matter what, the prisoners will not misbehave or try to escape because they don't want to risk not knowing when they are being watched. I think that this relates very well to the NSA and their subtle surveillance of the public. We don't know who our surveyors look like or when they're watching or what exactly they have on us, so we always behave. Except when we don't. And I wonder if this form of surveillance is ever justified. If it is when we find something that somebody was trying to hide, then what about those who have nothing to hide, and in different contexts what does "nothing to hide" mean? We discussed this a little bit during class, and how "nothing to hide" intersects heavily with privilege. For example, an undocumented immigrant has something to hide, but so does a murderer; you can't equate the two however. A man or woman who is in possesion of explicit photos also has something to hide, but the implications of those photos being found can be very different from an undocumented person who is tracked down by ICE.</p>

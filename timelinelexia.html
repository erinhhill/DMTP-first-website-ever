	Lexia on Timeline
    <br>
    <br>
    A discussion in relation to digital media studies has often been the disruption of the timeline; The fact that as technology develops the lines between time and space become more distinct as the separation between transportation and communication becomes greater and greater. As stated in the lexia, Bergson cites "the spatialization of time belies the 'fundamental illusion' underpinning Western scientific thought" (257). The sonic timeline, as described, stretches right to left across the window; a visual representation of the fluid change being undergone in a mere moment. With digital editing, however, we as creators have the power to edit this timeline non-linearly as opposed to "analog fast forwarding and rewinding" (258). As the creators we are able to stop, rearrange, or even delete the entire timeline, bending and melding it to serve our audio/visual narratory purposes.

    In the context of this class, the ability to utilize the digital encoding of sonic time allows a very unique system of editing and creating of digital media, rather than a linear-editing path. It is important, warns Massumi, that we not mistake visual perception of a media piece to actually represent the "endless possibilities" of nonlinear sonic timeline manipulation. In audio terms, timestretching is our ability to manipulate the granules of sound bytes into the sonic timeine to then be rearranged how we see fit. Relevant to us not only through our audio projects but also the audio component of our video projects, it is important to keep this all in mind when deciding to pursue a linear versus non-linear path of media manipulationa and editing.

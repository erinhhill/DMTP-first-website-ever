  <h3 style="text-align:center;">ABOUT THIS SITE</h3>
  <p>This project was born of a class assignment, but has quickly grown into more than just a means to a grade. The Hudson River was chosen as the subject of this project for various reasons, mainly due to the fact that it is one of the most heavily visted and used natural resources in New York City, and is starting to show signs of fatigue. Heavy use of the park and trail as well as outright abuse of the space has left significant damage that has gone largely overlooked up to this point.</p>

    <p>After several trips to the river to both passively observe and actively record, this website was created in order to act as an archive to document evidence of environmental and architectural fatigue. Audio, video, and image files have been posted in order to properly communicate the current state of the Hudson River. These files are minimally edited and 100% original.</p>

    <p>With the impending construction of two more major pipelines through New York, the AIG and the Pilgrim, it is imperitive that we stop to think about the effect our actions may have. Now more than ever, we have the power to both damage the environment irreparably or help it heal. Whatever the outcome of our decisions, there is no doubt that we will feel the consequences of our actions.</p>

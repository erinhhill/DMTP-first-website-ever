    1. I want to follow the walkway for a while and point out every manmade infrastructural object tied to the river, like plumbing and wiring such as this pothole type thing covering some electrical circuitry inside the walkway for the city of New York. I'm thinking of doing this in a very low to the ground and shaky camera style. It is worth noting that I plan on having a music track over the entire video, but have not yet decided on what tone I want to go with. I am leaning towards slightly nostalgic and melancholy, but at a faster pace than your average "chill" song.
    <br>
    2. The second scene I want to do is immediately jumping into what kinds of objects users of the space leave behind, mainly trash. The purpose of showing some trash before the nature imagery is to juxtapose it with more trash imagery afterwards, giving a sense of endlessness to the trash and making the affect of it seem that much worse to the viewer. I've got a great shot of a bottle floating in the water, bobbing up and down, going nowhere that would fit really well in this part.
    <br>
    3. This is where I will really begin to focus in on the negative environmental stress the river is under. I have already featured these drainage signs in my photos, but now I want to really zoom in and enhance the clip of this sign even more, giving the audience a chance to read about the possible sweage that may drift into the river when it storms. this will be with a slight shake in the camera, almost a sway, like the water breaking against the bank of the river. Other examples of this would be the decaying of various wooden docks, built up algae on the concrete stormbreakers, and clips of other animals, human and not, visiting the space.
<br>
4. I will briefly switch from a scene of environmental stress to one of resilience. There are several types of flowers thay have managed to grow through the wood and concrete of the river, and they blossom quite beautifully. This scene will be a calm respite from the imagery in the first half of the video, and I will quickly jolt the viewer back into the harsh affect of the reality of the river; environmental stress and damage.
<br>
5-6. I will quickly glance over authoritative imagery within the park, such as rules, warning signs, signs reminding people of the authority figures within the park, police cars, sanitation crews, and more. I'd like to split this up into active versus passive authority. Active being signs and items that directly tell a visitor to follow a specific rule, such as figure 5. Passive being more subtle signs of authority, such as the "Hudson river Park" sign, letting visitors know where they are and telling them that there are unspoken rules of decorum for behaving within the space. Littering is not one.
<br>
7. More littering! Trash, decay, overuse, stressful imagery everywhere. I would like this part to be a montage if I can grab enough quality footage, maybe having the frames repeat over and over again faster and faster. this is meant to be the second slap in the face to the viewer, and the music will pitch at the end signalling the River's pain.
<br>
8. I will fade out slowly on film of direct human abuse to the river, such as graffiti, intentional property damage, intentional littering, blatant disregard for the rules and the wellbeing of the space, and all around vandalism. The music will slowly come to a fade as the camera, slowly shaking and swaying, blurs and fades past this mark of graffitti onto the river, and the video will fade to black.

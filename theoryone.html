<p>I chose the Hudson River as my ecology because, for my entire life, water has been the ultimate environmental affect. I grew up in Northern California and no matter where I went the water was always close by. At any point in my life regardless of what I am dealing with or feeling, being by a large, open body of water has the inexplicable ability to calm me down and put me in a very peaceful state of mind. It is this love for the water from which arose my desire to protect it and the creatures that live in it. I began volunteering at a marine science institute in Redwood City, CA in 2011 and stayed with them for over a year. Working on the San Francisco Bay with conservationists and scientists, I developed a passion for education and conservation of all water-based ecosystems. This passion has become a part of me, an invisible limb that has attached to me permanently; I cannot help but care about it.</p>
<p>When it became time to choose an ecology, the Hudson River wasn't even my first choice. Late one night close to the deadline of submitting our ecology for approval, I sent a panicked email asking to change my choice. I realized that this was the only place in the city I could come to again and again and never get tired of. There are so many issues tied to the Hudson River that I'll be able to document this semester, mainly the environmental abuse this river has suffered at the hands of corporations and residents of New York City alike. I feel that if I were to choose any other place in New York City, I just wouldn't be able to pour my heart into the work like I know I will with the river. In terms of affect theory, the Hudson River is the perfect example. In "The Transmission of Affect," Theresa Brennan talks about the potential of an affect to have different effects on different people. For example, as a lover of all things H20, the Hudson River is my escape from the rest of the city. It puts me at peace and serves as a quiet sanctuary for rest and objective reflection upon my own life. To another, the runners and bikes that are constantly speeding up and down the park trail may be a source of anxiety rather than relaxation. To the runners themselves, the river may be a source of energy and invigoration that allows them to push themselves physically onwards down the path. I am looking forward to documenting the different types of affect people will be experiencing by the river this semester in various forms of media.</p>
<p>When looking at the condition of the river, it is not hard to understand Jane Bennett's ideas in "Vibrant Matter." Together, every object in and around the river contributes to the affect if the place, but looking at every thing individually, that affect can be broken down and studied further. What first comes to mind is the perception many people have of the river being dirty and polluted, yet there are several kayaking businesses that make plenty of money off of people who want to be as close to that water as possible. I wonder if people's belief that the river is dirty is based off of a collective affect, or off of individual things they have seen, such as an empty water bottle floating in the river or a dead rat. One thing I'll be every interested in looking at is how aware people are of actual environmental practices concerning the river, such as the GE spill of potential carcinogens (that may or may not be totally cleaned up). I also want to document how different people interact differently with the space in a conscious or unconscious way. I'm looking forward to metaphorically diving deeper into the river this semester, and am very excited to get started.</p>

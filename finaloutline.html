<p> Audience = New York City Environmental Protection Board
<br>
<br>
The Hudson River is one of the most heavily visited places in New York City, and despite the many programs in place dedicated to keeping it clean and preserving it, the space is showing signs of fatigue and neglect that cannot be ignored.
<br><br>
AIG Pipeline Proposed to run right through the Hudson and 100ft away from a Nuclear Power Plant
has disastrous potential effects
<br><br>
The affect of the space is clearly very relaxing but also of exhaustion. <br><br>
The space itself is slightly dilapidated, there is cracked cement, weeds, trash, debris in the water. <br><br>
I have decided to present my jQuery Photo Gallery as a testament to the things I have seen at the Hudson River in an attempt to clearly illustrate why this river needs more protecting; It is tired, it is sick, and it needs help. <br><br>
several photos show the usage of the space and how much pollution and litter there is

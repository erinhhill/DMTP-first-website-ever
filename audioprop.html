	What is immediately most striking about the Hudson River is the sudden transition you feel from West Street once you cross it to the riverside. I plan on demonstrating this significant change through my audio project. The river is an interesting place because of the juxtaposition of machines and natural water. It isn't immediately noticeable when visiting the space because of just how slow-paced and relaxed you can feel, but when paying attention to sound it is much easier to hear the roar of the highway and the whirr of helicopters not so far off. Miasma talks about assemblage in his work, and I want to use my audio project as a means to investigate the assemblage of the river through the affect produced by the sound of the space.

	There is so much to work with when considering the sounds you hear along the Hudson. I would like to split my audio into three different categories: Natural, Mechanical, and Human noises.
    <br>
    <br>
	Natural - The natural noises produced by the river obviously include things like the sound of the water hitting the wall next to the river, and birds such as finches seagulls and geese (which I saw during my trip to the river today). One other aspect of the audio I'm going to incorporate will actually be the wind you feel whenever you walk to the end of a pier stretching into the river. While it is often the bane of an audio recorder's existence, I believe that the wind and weather plays a very crucial role in the affect of the space. By listening to my audio, I hope that the listener will feel the affect so intensely that they can paint a vivid picture of what they think the weather is at the river (during the time of recording) in their minds. If I'm very lucky, we will experience a heavy rainfall I will be able to record as well.
    <br>
	Mechanical - The mechanical noises I hope to incorporate into my audio project will focus mainly on the manmade technology that surrounds the river. I will record how, no matter how far away you get into the river, the mechanical noises don't ever totally disappear. This is interesting because physically, entering the vicinity of the river creates a very calm, quiet affect. But when you start to pay closer attention, you hear everything from the car horns to the ferries to the portable stereos, albeit farther away. The mechanical noise does not go away and I plan on showing that in my audio work, as this creates an interesting relationship between the natural and the unnatural properties of the river, traditionally a soley-natural space.
    <br>
	Human - This one has a slight overlap with mechanical noise, but only slightly. When I say human noise I mean the noises people produce while occupying the space of the river. This varies in my experience from quiet conversation to screaming children to screaming adults. Because the River is a public space, all kinds of people are able to visit it and use it for many different types of things. Joggers along the river punctuate the calm vibe with loud footsteps and heavy breathing, while mothers walk their crying children to the water. Often times, groups of people will gather next to the water and listen to music (this is the overlap with mechanical noise). By documenting human noise, I will be able to see how we change the affect of the river according to our own actions.
